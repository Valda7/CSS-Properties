    <!-- NB: Use your heading tags for headings and paragraph tags for the paragraphs. Also format the write-ups with paddings, margins, and borders to beautify them.
The entire write-up should have a background color “white” and it should be in three sections

The first section: Write the heading “First section” and comment it out (use 18px). Let it contain your name and your love for technology. The text color should be green. Give formatting to it using bold tags and italics tags and the size should be 14px.

The second section: Write the heading “Second section” and comment it out (use 18px). Let it contain what you have learned so far and how css is important. The text color should be red. Give formatting to it using bold tags and italics tags and the size should be 14px

The third section: Write the heading “Third section” and comment it out (use 18px). Explaining the difference between paddings, margins, and borders. The text color should be blue. Give formatting to it using bold tags and italics tags and the size should be 14px. -->

            My name is <i>Omomayowa</i>, my friends call me <i>Valda</i> because
            I love power...maybe we all do but I am bold to admit my love for
            it. Well, power in itself is not a bad thing, it is the capacity to
            do something or act in a kind of way without any hinderance, it is
            the ability to direct or influence the behaviour of another amd this
            is simply what I want. Jesus's discipled had to tarry till they were
            endued with power from on high, only then were they able to carry
            out the mandate effectively. I love power and that is why I love
            tech, it has the ability to make one so powerful, all of the
            benefits it procurs are a wonder and my learning Software
            Development is a means of tarrying till I receive the power that I
            crave and then I can influence the world...of course in a good way.

          <h2>Importance of CSS</h2>
          <p>
            CSS is an amazing feature when it comes to building a website, it
            creates an amazing user experience as it helps put finnese to one's
            work. In the short period of harnesing the knowledge of web
            Development, I have discovered there abound a whole lot of CSS
            attributes and super exciting exploring with the various attributes.
            I have learnt how to add a border to an element and to make the
            edges less shaper with border radius, how to style a word to make it
            bolder or italized with font-weight, how to add padding, margin,
            colors and more

            <h2>Margins, padding and borders</h2>
            <p>
              Padding, margins and borders play a major role in building a
              website. Padding is the inner space between the content and the
              border of a box while Margin is the outer space (or lack of space)
              surrounding the box. Border on the other hand is simply the
              perimeter of the box.
